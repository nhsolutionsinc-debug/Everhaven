  <h2 style="margin:0 0 .5rem 0;">Why We Do This</h2>
  <p style="line-height:1.6;">
    We believe in using housing to uplift people, not just to generate income.
    While short-term rentals like Airbnb serve travelers, we saw a deeper need‚Äîhelping
    individuals who lack stable housing. We started this business because we genuinely
    want to make a difference. It‚Äôs easy to say you want to help, but real impact
    comes from action. By providing safe, supportive housing, we give people the
    stability they need to rebuild their lives and move forward with dignity.
  </p> 

  <h3 style="margin:1.25rem 0 .5rem 0;">Our Mission</h3>
  <p style="line-height:1.6;">
    Our mission is to provide safe, stable, and supportive housing for individuals in need.
    We are dedicated to creating a welcoming environment where residents can regain independence,
    access essential resources, and build a brighter future. Through compassionate care and
    community partnerships, we strive to empower individuals on their journey toward stability
    and self-sufficiency.
